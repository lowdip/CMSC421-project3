Buffer:
The buffer implementation is a simple circular buffer. It's initialized with 20 nodes each with 0 where the last node points to the first.

Test:
The test functionality is a number of print statements testing edge cases. Each of the print statements say what should be returned if the test is performed correctly. The first set of numbers should include 20 0's and the second set should be 12345678912345678912. The last print of the buffer should display 00000678912345678912. If all of these are displayed correctly and the returns match what is said should be returned then the program is functioning correctly.
